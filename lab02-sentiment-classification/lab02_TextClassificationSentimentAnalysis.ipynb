To be more precise, we will build a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). We will look into the details of data preparation, functioning of each model and how the performance of those NNs could be measured efficiently. We will start our work using a toy corpus, so we can then extend our models to larger datasets.\n",

This module also provides a range of useful functionalities for data preparation: defining a preprocessing pipeline, splitting, batching, padding, iterating through data, loading pre-trained embeddings, building vocabulary, etc. Below we provide an example using the tokenizer as provided by the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) toolkit.\n",

For this bigger dataset, use `.cuda()` on any input batches/tensors, network modules and loss functions to place computations on the GPU. When working on **Google Colab**, make sure that you changed your runtime to GPU from the above menu.\n",
